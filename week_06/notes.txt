numpy (np)
Python library


Pandas (pd)
Python library
Pandas series is a 1d labeled array capable of holding any data type
can be initiated from ndarrats or dictionaries or scalar values

Pandas dataframe
2d labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types
can be initiated from many things like dict of tuples, series, list of dicts, etc.

looks much like an excel spreadsheet

pandas can hold heterogenous data, numpy cannot

Pandas: create table from scratch
Load data from another file
manipulate tabular data
and more

MapPlotLib (plt)
most popular python plotting library
based on pandas

quickly customize
text,colors,axes,legends,graph type, and more!

Object-oriented vs pyplot (MATLAB-based)
object-oriented explicitly creates figures and axes, and call methods on them
pyplot uses specific functions and only affects one axis at a time
assumes you're affecting the most recent axis you created
object-oriented gives you more control

pyplot good for super simple or interactive charts
object-oriented better for more  complex charts
plt. means pyplot
ax. means object-oriented, though sometimes that also uses plt.

formatting plots
for every set of points, you can optionally add a format
useful to look through matplotlib's plot documentation to see all options
or run help plt.plot in your window and it'll give oyu a full list of options
shortcuts exist too for some options! e.g. bo for blue circles

you can have multiple axes in one figure
create multiple subplots to show a side-by-side comparison
specify which position you want the subplot to appear in 
L to R, top to bottom

Plotly is another datavis library
for geospatial info, more complex than matplotlib
open source tool for creating interactive datavis
Cufflinks collects plotly with pandas to produce them

Seaborn sits on top of matplotlib, makes things more visually interesting
